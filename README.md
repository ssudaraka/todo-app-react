# todo-app-react

I created this simple Todo app to demonstrate some basic React concepts. I'm planning to integrate Supabase on top of it to have it persist data.
This is a learning experience, nothing much ðŸ˜Š

This app is created with Vite. To launch the application in dev mode use:

```
npm run dev
```

Planning to host the application on Vercel. Once I do that, I'll update the link here.
